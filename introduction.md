# Introduction

## Who Is This Guide For?

First and foremost: this guide is for everyone who's new to fighting games, and especially those who are looking at picking up a game like Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, Melty Blood, etc -- staples of the fighting game subgenre often (sometimes derogatorily) called **"anime fighters"**. This goes double for the person who really wants to play these games, but shies away from actually playing them out of anxiety, nerves, the overwhelming...everything that can happen when you play them.

To be honest, I'm writing this to be the guide I never had when I started to sit down and learn fighting games. I always felt like I had to cobble together understanding from five different sources and put together eight seemingly disconnected facts together just to figure out a single concept that felt like it ought to have been much easier to explain. Granted, as a librarian, I'm *used* to this sort of learning process, but I doubt that there's a lot of information professionals playing fighting games. By putting this guide together, I'm hoping to reduce the information overload that many otherwise excellent resources can cause when first encountered by the new player.

I also wrote this guide to specifically focus on learning, playing, and enjoying fighting games as a pasttime, not as a means to a competitive end. I don't think of myself as a competitive player, and I remember feeling completely overwhelmed by the level of focus on competition in most learning resources. It took a long time until I realized that all the focus on tournament play and competition was having a severely adverse effect on how I played these games. I do not wish to visit that feeling on anyone, so I'm keeping the guide focused on playing for fun.

## Why Learn With an Anime Fighter?

Anime fighters have a weird reputation in parts of the FGC: they are fast-paced, *extremely* technical, and often so visually flashy that you can have a hard time keeping track of whatever is actually happening on the screen. Your first match versus a human opponent is likely to see you get tagged at round start, pushed straight to the corner, and in 10 seconds you have lost the round and have no idea what just happened. And yet I firmly believe that they are also the most accessible fighting games for beginners.

A lot of that accessibility has to do with the central thing that defines an anime fighter: virtually every button you can press cancels into another button. This feature on its own defines the speed of these games, enables the flexibility and technicality that make them challenging to master, but most importantly: it makes them *more responsive*. And because they're more responsive, it's a lot easier to feel in control. If you're doing the time-honored fighting game beginner strategy of "press a bunch of buttons real fast" you get immediate tangible feedback: your buttons are cancelling into each other fluidly, and they're often all connecting as part of a continuous combo. The system responds satisfyingly to even the most absolute random input, which allows you to quickly intuit a simple gameplan. And as soon as you have your gameplan -- as soon as you start thinking about *when* you're going to press your buttons randomly rather than just pressing them constantly -- congratulations! You're engaging with the game systems and playing with intent.

That whole process -- from mashing to mashing with *purpose* -- can take less than ten minutes. Responsiveness and the fast pace of the game enables that quick learning. And more importantly, you can learn how to play with intent in the context of the game itself
